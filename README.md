# StateMachineCompiler
State Machine Compiler inspired by Uncle Bob

This is the State Machine Compiler (SMC) that Robert C. Martin builds in episodes 28, 29 and 30 of [Clean Coders](https://cleancoders.com/)

It can be used to create a Finite State Machine in several programming languages, like Java, C, Python, and C#, of course. In fact, it's built on C# ðŸ˜„
